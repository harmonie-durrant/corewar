## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction

The Corewar project is a game in which several programs called "Champions" will fight to stay the last one alive. Corewar is actually a computer simulation in which processors will share memory to run on.

The project is based on a virtual machine in which the champions will fight for memory by all possible means in order to win, the last champion being able to signal that he is alive wins the game. In other words, the last champion to execute the "live" instruction is declared winner.
